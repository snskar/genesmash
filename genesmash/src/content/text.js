    briefDescription: 'Animal behavior like cooperation and reciprocative altruism evolved over many millennia as an optimization against competing strategies. Optimal strategies can be identified by pitting them against each other and comparing their performance against a plethora of competing strategies in the gene pool. For this simulation, a famous game theory framework of the iterated prisoners dilemma game is utilized. Play this simulation to have these players battle it out.',
